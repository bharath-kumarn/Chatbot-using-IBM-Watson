                <p>agree 9-5 jobs pays well and buys you luxury, but making art feeds the soul. you are complete only when your soul is complete. Society is killing the creativity by making you follow the herd to succeed. The 'success' is an illusion which is defined by the amount you have in your bank account, the car drive etc. And we're stupid enough to follow it. We tend to live by the standards set by it. You study hard, get a decent job, marry someone, procreate, change your kids diapers, pay the bills and die one day as a nobody. We've become the by products of a lifestyle obsession. One day when we're in death bed we might think everything inside of us is worthless and embarassing.<br><br>
						"We must strive to find our voice. Most men lead lives of quiet desperation". These are the words said nby Mr.Keating in the movie 'Dead poet's society'. I wish I had a teacher like Mr.Keating <i>(By the way if you haven't watched the movie, please do watch it)</i>. I know a lot of peope who were once an artist, singer, athlete now gave up just to earn that extra buck. They work their ass off from monday to friday looking forward to the weekend. Now don't think they'll do something extraordinary in their weekend. They just be the couch potatoes eating junk, watching TV series. One of the great influencer 'Gary Vaynerchuck' says -"If you're living your life only on weekends, then you're shit is broken".</p>
